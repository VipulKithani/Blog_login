            The current social media applications like facebook, 
            twitter are centralized and also the data is owned by these companies. <br>
            We are aiming at a truly decentralised idea sharing platform for the masses 
            to express their ideology and views and support one another.<br><br> These posts won’t be 
            under and supervision and governance by a central authority and will be controlled by 
            the users themselves.<br><br> The posts cannot be censored nor deleted as a result of 
            which the users have full control over their data.
             The users have the option of encrypting their data and they themselves have 
            the authority to decrypt it.<br><br>
            All the direct messages can be encrypted in an end-to-end fashion thus keeping user’s
            privacy in the forefront. Our platform supports selective privacy of 
            information which provides users the authority to control the privacy of their posts.
